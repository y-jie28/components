# Notes

## Understanding Servers
One main difference between servers and our computers is that servers don't have a GUI. Servers handles requests over the network. 

localhost: browser sends the request to our computers instead of a server located somewhere in the world. 

Vue CLI will run a server on our computers that can handle requests if we type in "localhost". __The server will respond with a HTML, CSS and JS file we have in our project.__

The servers will also watch for file changes in our project. After a file is updated and saved, the server will refresh the browser to reflect the change. 

The number after localhost is the port number. A port number could be thought as a door, e.g. door to kitchen, door to bedroom. The CLI will search for an unused port and reserve it to run our application locally. 

## Files
Section about files generated by the Vue CLI. 

### .gitignore
Tells git which files to ignore when pushing to GitHub. 

### babel.config
Preset for babel. More info about the preset can be found [here](â€‹https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/babel-preset-app).

### package.json
The key is the __Vue CLI Packages in the__ "scripts" section. 

- @vue/cli-service: build and serve commands, helps build the project whether it is for development or production. 
- @vue/cli: additional commands for managing your project, to make working with Vue easier. 
- @vue/cli-service-global: allows you to use the build and serve commands globally. 

Contains config for "ESLint".

Although PostCSS config is not in the package.json, Vue will configure the PostCSS behind the scenes. 

## Directories
- node_modules
- public
- src

### node_modules
Contains the module installed for this project. It does not only contain webpack and babel, but Vue as well. 

### public
Contains the static assets like images and HTML file. 

### src
__Important.__ Most of applications' logic, templates, state managemnt, etc. will be in this directory. 

#### main.js
The createApp function from the Vue package and an object called __App__. 

__createApp__ creates the application. App is a Vue file, which is considered as a component. All components end with .vue extension. 

## Components
For a component to be valid, it must have the __template__ block. It can have one or multiple root element. 

The __name__ property can be added to a component. It is not required, but is useful when it comes to debugging. 
If no name is assigned, Vue will give it name "anonymous".
