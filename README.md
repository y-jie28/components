# Notes

## Understanding Servers
One main difference between servers and our computers is that servers don't have a GUI. Servers handles requests over the network. 

localhost: browser sends the request to our computers instead of a server located somewhere in the world. 

Vue CLI will run a server on our computers that can handle requests if we type in "localhost". __The server will respond with a HTML, CSS and JS file we have in our project.__

The servers will also watch for file changes in our project. After a file is updated and saved, the server will refresh the browser to reflect the change. 

The number after localhost is the port number. A port number could be thought as a door, e.g. door to kitchen, door to bedroom. The CLI will search for an unused port and reserve it to run our application locally.
